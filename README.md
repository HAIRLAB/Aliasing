# Numerical examples and code for 'A Sampling Theorem for Exact Identification of Continuous-time Nonlinear Dynamical systems'.
## SA consists of following subfolders
- **Linear**: The extendable rod and the identification of linear systems with growing sampling period
- **Fixed point**: The identification of nonlinear system with fixed point with growing sampling period
- **Limit cycle**: The identification of nonlinear system with limit cycle with growing sampling period

## First collect data for specific dynamical systems.
